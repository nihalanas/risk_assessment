## Introduction

A Risk Assessment tool for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Diabetes, which leverages LLM capabilities and provides personalized mitigation measures. 

The tool predicts an individual's susceptibility to CVD over the next decade and generates tailored mitigation measures based on user-provided attributes and the risk scores generated. 

Utilizing Streamlit for the user interface. Has trained classifiers models including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines for diabetes prediction, and adapted an existing risk model for the Indian population using Cox proportional hazard modeling. Leverages LLAMA2 LLM capabilitees using OLLAMA functionality for personalized mitigation generation, considering individual risk scores. 

___

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must have Ollama downloaded if you want the model to be run using Ollama.
> If you don't already have it installed, you can get it downloaded from [here](https://ollama.com/download)

___

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file, unzip it, and open the resulting folder in your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or you can also clone the repository by copying the web url and pasting it in your directory's
git bash terminal using the command:-
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nihalanas/cvd_last.git
   ```

2. Install the libraries mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/nihalanas/cvd_last/blob/main/requirements.txt)

   In VS Code Terminal run the following command:
   
   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
___

3. Download the Ollama application so that the LLM can be run. By default the model will run the Llama2 7B parameters model. 

___

> [!NOTE]
> Others models can also be run, the available models can be selected from the Ollama application and the name can be updated in the 'model' field in this [file](https://github.com/nihalanas/cvd_last/blob/main/llama2.py)

___

 
4. Run the [app.py](https://github.com/nihalanas/cvd_last/blob/main/app.py) python file.

   ```python
   Streamlit run app.py
   ```

____

5. Once the command is executed, the local URL where the streamlit application is running will be displayed in the VS Code terminal, navigate to the app by clicking on the link while having Ctrl on toggle.

____

6. Now the application must be running, there will be the section for diabetes prediction, followed by BMI calculator section, followed by CVD risk score generation section. Once you obtain the scores, you can go ahead and click on 'Generate Mitigation Measures' to have your personalized measures generated by the LLM running in the backend.

____

> [!NOTE]
> Running a LLM in the background using OLLAMA is a resource intensive computation, make sure you have a system with at least 8GB RAM, 16GB will be recommended. Depending on the system capabilites, the measures might take a few minutes to be generated. You can make sure it's working in the background by finding 'Running' action bar in the top right of the Streamlit application.
