    - **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Irregular heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
    - **Atypical Antipsychotic Use:** Taking medications for certain mental health conditions that may increase the risk of diabetes and heart problems.
    - **Corticosteroid Use:** Using medications like prednisone, which can raise blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.
    - **Impotence:** Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection, which can be a sign of heart disease.
    - **Migraine:** Severe headaches that may increase the risk of stroke and heart attack, especially in women.
    - **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** Inflammatory joint disease that can affect the heart and increase cardiovascular risk.
    - **Renal Disease:** Kidney damage that can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems.
    - **Myocardial Infarction (MI):** Heart attack, a serious condition caused by blocked blood flow to the heart muscle.
    - **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Autoimmune disease that can affect the heart, joints, and other organs.
    - **Treated Hypertension:** High blood pressure that requires medication to control and reduce the risk of heart disease.
    - **Type 1 Diabetes:** Autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells, leading to high blood sugar levels.
    - **Type 2 Diabetes:** Metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance or reduced insulin production, increasing the risk of heart disease.
    - **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Measure of body fat based on height and weight. A BMI over 25 indicates overweight, increasing the risk of heart problems.
    - **Family History of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):** Increased risk of heart disease if close relatives have had heart attacks, strokes, or other heart-related conditions.
    - **Waist-to-Hip Ratio:** Measure of fat distribution in the body. Higher ratios indicate more abdominal fat, increasing the risk of heart disease.
    - **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** Top number in blood pressure readings, indicating the pressure in arteries when the heart beats. High SBP increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.
    - **Standard Deviation of SBP:** Variation in blood pressure readings over time. High variability may indicate an increased risk of heart problems.
    - **Smoking Category:** Level of tobacco use, with higher categories indicating greater risk of heart disease and other health issues.
    - **Alcohol Consumption:** Amount of alcohol consumed, which can affect heart health depending on the quantity and frequency of consumption.

    - **Sudden Weight Loss:** Rapid and unintentional weight loss, which may occur due to uncontrolled diabetes or insulin deficiency.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of strength or energy, which can result from fluctuating blood sugar levels and inadequate glucose utilization in diabetes.
    - **Polyphagia:** Excessive hunger or increased appetite, often seen in uncontrolled diabetes due to the body's inability to use glucose for energy.
    - **Genital Thrush:** Yeast infection in the genital area, common in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes due to high blood sugar levels providing a favorable environment for yeast growth.
    - **Visual Blurring:** Blurred or impaired vision, which can occur due to high blood sugar levels affecting the shape of the eye lens in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes.
    - **Itchy Skin:** Persistent itching or dry skin, often experienced by individuals with uncontrolled diabetes due to poor circulation and nerve damage.
    - **Irritability:** Mood swings or irritability, which can result from fluctuating blood sugar levels affecting brain function and emotional regulation.
    - **Delayed Healing:** Slow wound healing or frequent infections, which can occur in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes due to impaired immune function and poor circulation.
    - **Partial Paresis:** Weakness or paralysis affecting part of the body, commonly seen in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes due to nerve damage (neuropathy).
    - **Muscle Stiffness:** Stiffness or rigidity in the muscles, which can result from nerve damage (neuropathy) or reduced blood flow in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes.
    - **Alopecia:** Hair loss or thinning, which can occur in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes due to poor circulation and nutrient deficiencies affecting hair follicles.
